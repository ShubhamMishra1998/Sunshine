## External Libraries used
### [OkHttp ](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/network-ops)
HTTP is the way modern applications network. It’s how we exchange data & media. Doing HTTP efficiently makes your stuff load faster and saves bandwidth.
#### OkHttp is an HTTP client that’s efficient by default:
* HTTP/2 support allows all requests to the same host to share a socket.
* Connection pooling reduces request latency (if HTTP/2 isn’t available).
* Transparent GZIP shrinks download sizes.
* Response caching avoids the network completely for repeat requests.
